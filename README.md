Logistic regression and AdaBoost classifiers are used with hyperparameter tuning to determine whether a sequence increases or decreases at the 10th value from the 9th value. Data retrived from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

The data file is too large fot github but the ipynb file is self-contained and downloads the data from a public Google Drive folder.

Nested cross validation for both hyperparameter tuning and model performance utilized and standard time series data transformations applied.
